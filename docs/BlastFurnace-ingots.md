if you and your dev are confident lets do it then - so:

introducing a score, called "ingots". You gain ingots by:
Large deposits (above 2 eth)
referring people - both total Eth amount referred and number of wallets referred that bought at least .1 eth count. 

Maybe it should cap out at like, 50 eth bought or referred and 150 wallets referred. That is to say, If you deposited 50 eth (one deposit or many) or you referred 50 eth, or you referred 150 wallets that  deposited at least .1 eth, your score would be maxed. If you did all those 3 things, it wouldn't be any higher. So each of those things give you points and theres a cap. 

What do ingots do? 

 - a yield multiplier of up to x1.5

 - an increase in the % of referral rewards you get based up to 20% (base amount i think is 12.5% so you get +7.5% max)

- wallets with ingots will be airdropped the token when it releases, prorata





Right now it's to see what the original referrals do in the contract, 

Rename egg to ingot.

If the referral does nothing then make referrals to add a certain amount of ingots to the referred address with a maximum limit. So it would send ignots equal to 20% of the referrer's current balance. 

Every address that calls 'buyIngots' with up to 0.5 ETH gets their address stored in the airdrop array. 

Then add an address array for airdrop qualifiers
